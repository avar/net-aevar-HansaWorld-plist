This is a startup script for the older Hansax program on older Mac OS
X systems (probably OSX 10.3) that don't have the new launchd
facility. I wrote it in 2004.

It assumes that the Hansax program is at `/Hansax/Hansax`. To use it:

    sudo mkdir /System/Libary/StartupItems/Hansa
    sudo cp Hansa StartupParameters.plist /System/Libary/StartupItems/Hansa/

Then when you reboot you'll see "Starting Hansa Financials".
